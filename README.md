Contribution model
------------------

PyFoundation follows the Fork and Pull model. Fork the main project, make your changes, and create a pull request. It will be reviewed, and, if it passes the review, will be merged. If it doesn't quite pass, you will be asked to make changes, fix bugs, etc. Once you have made the necessary changes, it will be merged. There is a possibility that your pull request may be completely denied if it fails the review.
